Project: Jerl 6 -- Perl 6 for the JVM
Current Maintainer: Katrina "the lamia" Payne AKA Full Metal Harlot

Target Start Date: Currently Octobre 15th 2009.

Synopsis:

Katrina was joking around on some of the the various Perl 6 channels that she 
should produce a version of Perl 6 for the JVM. Referring to the usual 
distain for Java many Perl users feel.

Well, just after she had suggested it, people started saying it was a good 
idea as Parrot still is not entirely complete (when she was joking around 
about this Circa August 2009), and putting Perl 6 onto the JVM would 
immediately allow for Perl 6 to appear into various Enterprise solutions. The 
kind that many people would normally rely on Clojure--possibly JRuby. It is 
a horrible shame that at the time of typing this Jython is not known to be up 
to date with Python 2.6.

So realising that Perl 6 on the JVM would be a good idea, Katrina then 
decided to slate start of development for Jerl 6 (pronounced "Girl Six" 
(possibly as "Girl Sex", it you can conceivably get away with that)--it is a 
form of bad pun) for Octobre. It has been a little delayed. She will begin 
work on it... hopefully well before Rakudo Star and the .Net/Mono versions of 
Perl 6 are well into production usage >.>
